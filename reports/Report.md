# Part 1: Report

I designed a scalable system that is capable of handling multiple clients, which utilizes Node.js, FTP, and MongoDB. Unfortunately, I was not able to set up the deployment and test the performance of it, although first part of the system (batch ingestion) was fully implemented and designed with scalability in mind (i.e. server is stateless, no bottlenecks, easy containerization etc.).
